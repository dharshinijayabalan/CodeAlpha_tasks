# 🚀 CodeAlpha Internship Projects

Welcome to my internship project repository under **CodeAlpha**! This README provides a summary of the Python-based mini-projects I developed during my internship, showcasing my understanding of core programming concepts and problem-solving skills.



## 🔤 Project 1: Word Guessing Game (Hangman Style)


### 🎯 Task Objective
To design a console-based word guessing game where users try to guess the hidden word letter by letter within a limited number of attempts.


### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
 **Programming Language**: Python
 **Library**: `random` (standard library)


### ✨ Features
- Random selection of words from a predefined list
- User-friendly console interface
- Limited number of attempts (6 lives)
- Real-time word display with correctly guessed letters
- Win or lose conditions with word reveal at the end
- Simple loop and condition-based logic


## 💬 Project 2: Simple Rule-Based Chatbot


### 🎯 Task Objective
To create a basic chatbot that interacts with the user through fixed responses based on keyword recognition.


### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python


### ✨ Features
- Greets the user and responds to simple queries:
  - `hello` → `Hi`
  - `how are you` → `I'm fine, thanks!`
  - `bye` → ends the conversation
- Responds with a default message for unknown inputs
- Interactive loop until the user types "bye"
- Can be expanded with more responses
